# domainry-agent-sdk

Deployment-neutral contract for Domainry Agent execution. Agent implementations own definitions, dialog/session behavior, proposals and provider-execution state, including task, interactive-run, claim/lease/fencing and tool-ledger state. Runtime owns workflow state, current business authorization, Runtime tool/effect policy and business records.

The SDK contains no Runtime or implementation dependency. Project composition selects a Module or SaaS Factory explicitly.

## Package layout

- The root package is the stable `Factory`, `Binding`, runner, schema, tool-catalog, and dialog-state entrypoint.
- `persistence` owns Agent execution-state application ports, persistence capabilities and the shared redacted task-run view. Agent's HTTP adapter and worker assembly consume `ExecutionStateBinding`; Runtime does not mutate Agent repositories or implement a second task/interactive state machine.
- `modulehost` describes infrastructure borrowed by an embedded Agent module and the narrow Runtime fact/effect ports used by Agent application services.
- `saashost` describes the SaaS composition boundary.
- `contracttest` contains deployment-parity tests; `state` contains shared Agent state values.

Concrete SQL stores remain in the Agent implementation repository; the SDK exposes only their deployment-neutral contracts through `persistence`.

`ConversationBinding` is an optional extension exposing `ConversationService` for
durable personal conversations. It is separate from `InteractiveRunner` and its
legacy session projection. `conversation.go` owns messages, run/event state,
explicit personal memory, summary and stateless model contracts;
`conversation_http.go` owns the `/agent/conversations` typed Action/route contract.
`persistence.ConversationRepository` owns atomic enqueue, lease/fencing, frozen
model inputs, draft deltas and summary persistence ports. Pure-text Conversation remains supported.
`ConversationStreamingModel` optionally streams text through a synchronous commit callback;
`conversation.stream.v1` advertises this capability. Drafts belong to one attempt and
are separate from complete messages. `ConversationStatusProvider` supplies local
readiness without invoking the model. Descriptors may advertise Conversation alone;
task capabilities still require the complete start/poll/cancel trio.

`ConversationAttachmentService` optionally exposes private conversation file
upload, list, detail, original-byte download and deletion. Conversation-enabled
hosts supply the shared `modulehost.ArtifactHost` plus a current
`ConversationAttachmentAuthorizer`; these file operations have separate Identity
actions and are not model tools. Uploads accept a client idempotency key, filename
and up to 16 MiB of bytes; authority and indexing permissions are never file
input. Browser HTTP uses raw binary, while trusted SaaS RPC uses bounded base64.
Attachment metadata is registered as `owner=agent, kind=attachment` in the
shared Artifact store, immutable bytes use its ContentWriter, and subject plus
conversation bindings carry ownership. Terminal Artifact state revokes reads and
drives idempotent Blob cleanup; the retained index-work queue also carries cleanup
work, so there is no private attachment metadata or cleanup table. A stored file
is not indexed or shared; personal libraries and shared-library membership use
the separate contract below. `TaskAttachmentStorage` remains the private
content port for task-execution attachments and is not a conversation attachment
persistence authority.

`KnowledgeLibraryService` optionally manages a unique personal library and
shared libraries with reader/editor/manager memberships. Hosts inject a
`KnowledgeLibraryAuthorizer` for live Identity action checks and validation of
active workspace users. The repository independently enforces current library
membership and serializes settings/member mutations with the expected library
revision, preserving at least one manager. Libraries belong to the trusted
Runtime/Workspace; personal libraries never accept other members. These seven
management operations are HTTP/SDK capabilities, not model tools. Library
creation does not bind a remote source, upload documents, or change existing
knowledge-search permissions; document ownership and indexing use the separate
optional `KnowledgeDocumentService`.

`ConversationLibraryKnowledgeSource` optionally extends the revalidating
knowledge source with a readable-library catalog and scoped search/read.
`LibraryKnowledgeConversationTools` publishes `knowledge_libraries` plus v2
search/read schemas with optional `library_id`; `KnowledgeConversationTools`
keeps its legacy v1 schemas. Library IDs only select trusted host bindings:
implementations check current membership, archive state and Identity action
access before/after remote calls and whenever saved evidence is reused.
Evidence and citations preserve `library_id`; the same document ID may exist
in different libraries. Hosts must isolate each library's remote KB from other
libraries and the legacy source. `KnowledgeLibrary.knowledge_configured` reports
a binding's presence only, not remote availability or indexing completion.

`KnowledgeDocumentService` exposes library document upload/list/get/download/delete
via Module HTTP and the SaaS SDK, with separate `KnowledgeDocumentPermission`
actions and current library role checks. `KnowledgeDocumentStorage` binds immutable
originals to Runtime/Workspace/Library, independently of uploader membership.
`ManagedKnowledgeDocumentSource` adds explicit passage projection and a stable
physical source identity; implementations must exclude unmapped response fields.
Host activation is explicit, requires a dedicated source and persistent management
markers, and does not automatically convert conversation attachments or enable model writes.
`KnowledgeLibrary.documents_configured` reports whether the host has configured
document management for that library. It is separate from read-only knowledge
binding availability and does not grant Identity actions or prove index readiness.

`KnowledgeAttachmentImportService` optionally saves an owned conversation attachment
as an independent library document. Its HTTP/SaaS input carries only source IDs,
expected attachment revision and client receipt. The host checks the distinct import
action, target upload and source download permissions; the repository rechecks
source state inside target reservation/commit. Private provenance remains server-side.
A committed copy survives source deletion; subsequent access follows target-library
permissions. Retrying a completed receipt never reads the former private source.

`KnowledgeDocumentSource` is a separate trusted host port for pushing original
bytes, inspecting the actual upstream indexing state, and requesting deletion.
It is not a model tool or public file-management endpoint. Applications must
authorize recorded document/library ownership and persist lifecycle work;
acknowledgements do not prove indexing or deletion is complete. Missing status
is scoped to current upstream permissions and is not a global existence oracle.

`conversation.execution.v1` is an optional execution extension:
`ConversationAgentModel` streams one normally terminated model step;
`ConversationToolHost` provides a live catalog, authorization, invocation and
reconciliation. `persistence.ConversationExecutionRepository` freezes steps and
records logical tool calls under a lease/fence. Model-native continuation state
is server-only; `ConversationRun.Steps` contains bounded public previews.
`PersonalConversationTools` and `ConversationToolActions` are the source-owned
catalog and permission manifest for implemented read tools. Registering an
Action does not grant it to a user. These additions do not add mandatory methods
to existing `Binding`, `ConversationModel` or `ConversationRepository` ports.

`ConversationTrajectoryService` is an optional completed-run inspection and
forking extension. It projects the exact saved model-visible messages, complete
public tool definitions, recorded model responses, tool calls/results, context
boundary metadata and per-item hashes after rechecking the current reader and
every reusable source. Provider continuation state, credentials, confirmation
material and authorization evidence stay server-only. `display` reads the
projection, `model_fixture` returns recorded responses/tools without invoking a
provider, and `live_rerun` creates an independent conversation that has no active
run until a user sends new input. `Conversation.Fork` is provenance only; it
does not make one Agent subordinate to another or grant access to the source.
Fork context converts recorded tool calls and tool results into inert historical
data, so creating or continuing a fork never replays an old effect automatically.
The private `persistence.ConversationForkRepository` seed is verified against the
source run's exact completed event boundary and trajectory digest on every use.

`ConversationLifecycleExtension` is the public, startup-only execution
lifecycle port. Extensions declare a stable key, implementation version,
deployment configuration version, ascending order, policy/observer kind,
failure mode and exact stage subscription. The stages cover input admission and
accepted input,
context assembly and safe compaction, model request/completion/failure/retry,
tool execution before/after, run completion and task completion. The ordered
definition manifest is frozen on foreground, background and delegated runs;
recovery rejects a changed manifest instead of applying new behavior to old
input. `modulehost.ConversationLifecycleHost` contributes extensions during
the existing host assembly phase. Runtime installation or removal is not part
of this version.

Policy decisions are deliberately narrow. A context policy may append bounded
trusted planning instructions without reordering source messages; a compaction
policy may lower the engine context ceiling; a retry policy may reduce attempts,
disable retry or increase bounded backoff. No decision grants an Identity
action, changes an Agent/model/tool snapshot, skips current authorization or
confirmation, rewrites arguments/results, or marks an effect successful.
Observers cannot return decisions and always continue on error. Fail-closed
policies are allowed only before an effect; model/tool completion and terminal
events must continue so a callback cannot invalidate a committed result or
receipt. Events contain deterministic IDs and owned request/result copies so
handlers can deduplicate delivery and cannot mutate engine state by retaining
references. Handler errors and panics are sanitized before they reach a run.

`ConversationStepInputSizer` optionally measures the exact serialized provider
request with the same encoder used for streaming, without network calls or
effects. Agent uses this measurement for context admission and resume checks.
Source proofs, authorization fields and other omitted metadata remain in the
complete frozen execution snapshot. Models without this port retain conservative
snapshot sizing; invalid measurements and encoder errors stop execution.

`ConversationContextSource` is a startup-registered, read-only context boundary
for project instructions, current business records, file references and other
host data. Its definition fixes scope, trust, refresh interval, assembly order
and byte budget. `ReadConversationContext` authorizes and returns one versioned
value; `AuthorizeConversationContext` rechecks that exact frozen version before
every model request and historical reuse. Stable prefixes are limited to
run-frozen project instructions. Dynamic values remain outside that prefix,
and source versions, pressure, compaction and provider-reported cache usage are
available through bounded run diagnostics without exposing source content or
authorization hashes.

`delegation_source_read` version 2 optionally accepts `dependency_id` for an
exact frozen upstream dependency of the current delegation. Original agreement
requirements determine its admitted source prefixes; every page rechecks the
upstream audience, original publisher/provider and current reader's data rights.
This grants no upstream execution or conversation control. Pages preserve the
upstream ID and original reference; the tool response's top-level recorded
reading reference can prove completion. Version 1 definitions remain available
for validating saved original pages, while new invocations use version 2.

The optional `persistence.ConversationAgentAncestryRepository` returns only
agent IDs along the current owner's original delegation source chain for
matching and cycle exclusion. Implementations may follow original subjects
internally; this port never grants private upstream conversation or result
access. Existing hosts can retain their conservative ancestry traversal.

`ConversationToolAvailability` optionally supplies live connection state and
tool switches. Agent filters the authorized host catalog through this policy
before freezing each model step, checks it again after concrete authorization,
and prevents disconnected business/knowledge sources from being called during
historical-result revalidation. Return true only for enabled tools with usable
connections in the supplied runtime/workspace/user scope, including explicit
true for local tools. Return false for disabled, disconnected, expired or
unknown state; errors fail closed with a sanitized public code. Checks have a
bounded context and must not refresh credentials or perform tool effects.
The policy only removes registered tools; it cannot grant permissions or change
their schemas, effects, timeouts, result limits or idempotency strategies.
Existing hosts without this optional port retain their host-owned catalog and
authorization behavior. Account management/refresh remains a host responsibility.

`ConversationBusinessSource` supplies scoped business discovery and reads,
including typed filters, field selection, page/cursor results and revalidation
of saved evidence. Cursors are read positions, not grants; hosts still resolve
current Identity and enforce record/field policy. A missing total is unknown.

An optional `ConversationBusinessEvidenceSealer` can attest the immutable read
result before Agent stores it. Its `host_proof` is an integrity proof, not a
credential or grant. The host must verify the complete evidence before sealing
and recheck current access on every reuse. A sealer failure prevents the result
from entering model context. Existing sources may omit this extension and keep
their existing revalidation semantics; frozen content must never be rewritten
to pretend a historical read is current.

Module hosts assembled in two stages can implement
`modulehost.DeferredConversationHost`. When enabled, the module opens storage
and definitions first; `Conversations()` returns nil until the startup-only
`modulehost.ConversationApplicationHostBinder.BindConversationHost` receives a
`modulehost.ConversationApplicationHost` with a current authorizer and optional
business source. This host needs no Interactive, Task, Proposal, Audit or Analysis
ports and no ProcessID or TaskDefinition. Conversation workers and HTTP adapters
are created only then. The existing full `BindApplicationHost` also supports
deferred conversations for hosts that already implement the legacy ports.

The current application authorizer must additionally implement
`ConversationExecutionAuthorizer`, unless the module options supply an explicit
execution authorizer. Binding without it fails even for a text-only model.
This port receives stable owner identifiers and an application-selected stage,
not credentials or cached permissions. It checks the current execution admission
policy before enqueue/resume/respond, on each worker attempt, before model and
tool calls, and before committing a reply. Existing conversation send/resume
actions require a current authenticated principal; tool/resource permissions
remain independent. Explicit resume/response persists the current trusted role
selection without changing the owner or original operation scope. A false result
or error stops execution, and the implementation must honor the bounded context.
Legacy service-only deployments must supply their own current policy; this
interface does not make their service API key a live user authorization.

Finish binding before serving HTTP or reading services, descriptors or adapters.
The conversation-only binder rejects missing authorizers, repeated calls, calls
after Close and bindings that did not opt into deferred startup. It never
replaces a live service. A later legacy application binding can add the old
ports without replacing conversations. With deferred startup, automatic tool,
authorization and availability defaults come from the bound conversation host;
explicit conversation options still take precedence. Ordinary hosts without
the optional marker keep their existing startup behavior.

Run `go test ./...` before publishing an immutable SDK version.

Business catalog selectors use `kind=objects` (default), `actions`, `workflows`, or `relations`.
Object details expose readable fields; `readable=false` is discovery-only.
For operations, `object_key` filters a bounded list, and `action_key` or
`workflow_key` expands the payload schema. A null schema is not a declared
empty payload. `ValidSelector` checks selector combinations; hosts must still
validate size limits and live permissions. Discovery is never execution approval.

`ConversationBusinessWorkflowSource` optionally adds `workflow_start` and
`workflow_get`. Expand a workflow's catalog entry for its `execution_version`
and input schema. Start receives only that version, the declared key and business
input from the model; Agent supplies trusted authority, durable confirmation and
stable invocation metadata separately. An `accepted` receipt is not completion:
retain its process ID and query the host's actual state and business outcome.
Terminal states can also indicate rejection, cancellation or failure. Raw workflow
variables and internal node outputs do not belong in the public state projection.

Workflow hosts own instance and participant authorization and must recheck it on
every query and historical reuse. Start reconciliation checks owned durable
receipts; it never reclaims an existing unresolved start. Only a known-absent
operation may enter an atomic start that refuses to reclaim existing work. A
signed historical progress snapshot may retain its original waiting state after
completion, provided its integrity and current access are independently verified.

`kind=relations` requires the source `object_key` and pages published forward /
reverse relationship keys. Object summaries may expose a bounded `relations`
list and `relations_next_cursor`. The optional `ConversationBusinessRelationSource`
adds `query_related_records`; unsupported hosts do not publish that tool.
Each call follows one relationship from one readable record, with at most 25
targets, typed filters, fields and a cursor. Hosts bind cursors to the source and
relationship, and reauthorize source rows, relationship fields and targets on
every page and during `RevalidateBusiness`. No recursive expansion or model-
selected target object is accepted; further hops consume ordinary run budgets.

`ConversationFactory.ConversationEnabled` allows hosts to start configured
persistent conversations even when their manifest has no legacy Agent/Task
entries. It is an optional startup declaration, not a change to those entrypoints.

`ConversationBusinessActionSource` optionally adds `invoke_action`. Executable
action details expose `execution_version`, target kind and the actual payload
schema, including optimistic-concurrency fields when required. The generic
catalog projection version is not an execution version. Model arguments contain
only the declared target, action version and business payload; trusted authority,
frozen confirmation and stable idempotency metadata arrive separately from Agent.

The host must enforce live business and record permissions, exact contracts and
its existing action rules. Agent currently requires confirmation of each concrete
business write. An interaction may publish up to 20 concrete remaining operations
from its frozen step. An authenticated `scope=listed_operations` response explicitly
approves that list; an empty scope approves only the current call. Agent persists
an exact per-call confirmation for each listed operation in the same transaction,
with `AuthorizationID` linking the original grouped consent. New calls, changed
arguments and other runs never inherit it. Personal memory, todo or artifact write scopes do not authorize
business mutations. A confirmed request cannot satisfy an additional host approval
requirement by itself.

Action results contain durable invocation and affected-record references, not raw
handler output. An uncertain result needs reconciliation against the owned host
receipt. Reconciliation must not reclaim or repeat an existing unresolved action;
a conclusively absent action may start only through an atomic create-or-replay
boundary that cannot reclaim an intervening execution. Historical acknowledgement
revalidation is read-only and checks the entire receipt and current access.

## Browser gateway

`browsergateway.NewHandler` composes the SDK Agent and Identity bindings into a same-origin browser boundary. The caller provides static files and may supply its existing HTTP router so conversation requests retain host admission, authorization and audit. It does not import the Agent implementation or open module databases.

`browsergateway.Options.ModuleAdapters` mounts declared owner HTTP routes under the same current Identity and page-scope boundary. Every request resolves a live AccessBundle; owner adapters retain action/data authorization. `NavigationFiles` allows only exact static HTML landing routes for cross-site GET navigation, never anonymous module commands. Reserved service paths and undeclared permissions are rejected. The host owns module composition; this SDK does not import Integration or Connector implementations.

The optional `businessrpc` package transports the existing complete business-host
profile over bounded, authenticated HTTP. It does not implement records, actions,
workflows, reports, confirmation storage or retries. `NewHandler` requires a host
that re-resolves current Identity and tool access; each service credential is
pinned to one runtime, workspace, Identity application and Identity issuer. `Open` verifies the
expected source identity and `ContractSHA256()` before exposing a client; every
request carries the immutable binding. Both deployments must use the same trusted
Identity domain, with `Scope.IdentityIssuer` supplied from the actual Identity
binding. Browser credentials and model-supplied authorities are not valid
inputs to this server-to-server trust boundary.

The optional shared Report/Analysis read ports keep the actual reader in the
RPC authority and carry the original producer only as proof provenance. Report
verifies its original HMAC and current source state; the reader independently
needs results-read, audience and field access. Runtime proves that the reader's
current row/organization projection covers the producer's projection without
executing the old query. Agent independently checks publication of the exact
receipt in the containing delegation; these ports do not publish private data.
Neither producer provenance nor a saved read proof grants execution, a worker
lease or user confirmation. Missing source support remains unavailable.

The four shared read operations change the strict business profile contract to
`0975df00be8381ea7a3ec45a9b2aa68dedcd999c8c6901bd1ad8f82466374a53`.
Client and server pins must be updated together. Existing request/result DTOs
and the required Go Backend interface remain unchanged; a mismatched handshake
is rejected before any source operation.

The profile includes catalog/query/get/relations, action authorization/invocation/
reconciliation, workflow authorization/start/reconciliation/state, and current
source revalidation/sealing. Unsupported operations remain denied by the host's
current tool authorizer. Protocol DTO shapes and semantics are hashed separately
from the Agent product HTTP API. Transport accepts only HTTPS or explicitly local
HTTP, refuses credential-bearing URLs and redirects, bounds requests/responses to
1 MiB and calls to 65 seconds, and disables automatic body replay. A write without
a trustworthy response returns `uncertain`; explicit reconciliation keeps the
original host idempotency and confirmation metadata. No report or arbitrary SQL
endpoint is introduced.

`ConversationConfirmationVerifier` aliases the neutral Tools SDK confirmation
port. Agent offers it to trusted startup tool composition to check an exact
persisted approval and the current worker lease. An adapter must not treat a
caller-constructed confirmation receipt as authority. The port exposes neither
the Agent repository nor an HTTP approval route; it does not grant permission
to read an old result after current source access is revoked.
